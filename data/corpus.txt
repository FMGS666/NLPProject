great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...
I thought this place was totally overrated.
Fish is so very fresh.
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
The hostess was very pleasant.
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
Good, fast service.
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer. 
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
The wine list is excellent.
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.
Pizza here is consistently good.
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
Located at the end of a magnificent block.
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 
Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot. 
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
This is a fun restaurant to go to.
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.
The food was bland oily.
The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
I LOVE their Thai
Excellent food for great prices
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
THE SERVICE IS AMAZING, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in NYC.
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
the turkey burgers are scary!
It's a small cute restaurant.
Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
Very affordable and excellent ambient!
The main entree was also very good.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
But the pizza is way to expensive.
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
The waiter was attentive.
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
Always great service!
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
All the staff is absolutely professional!! 
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC!
The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
Amma is nothing special.
The food was good, the place was clean and affordable.
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
Great neighborhood joint.
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough. 
I'm partial to the Gnocchi.
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 
You cannot go wrong with this place.
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.
Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.
Great Atmosphere
Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
Fish was overdone.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
He offers subpar service and has no personality.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
I am happy i did the food was awsome.
The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
the waitstaffs are nice though.
For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
the spinach is fresh, definately not frozen...
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
we love th pink pony.
The design and atmosphere is just as good.
Everything on the menu is great. 
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
The entree was also very good.
This place is always very crowded and popular.
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...
I/we will never go back to this place again.
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
Service was quick.
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
bottles of wine are cheap and good.
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
Thank You Emilio.
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
Food is great.
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
The staff is no nonsense.
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.
For me dishes a little oily, but overall dining experience good.
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
I have never had cheescake like this.
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
Waitstaff are very friendly.
The family seafood entree was very good.
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.
Food was okay, nothing great.
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 
Faan is sooo good.
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish. 
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.
Subtle food and service
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
Look, the appetizers were really good.
im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low pirces.
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
Food is great and inexpensive.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.
The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri.
Great Shabu Shabu
Everything about this restaurant was special.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low pirces.
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future.
Excellent food, although the interior could use some help.
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
Not enough wines by the glass either.
Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Great food!
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.
Delicious crab cakes too.
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.
I lOVE THIS PLACE!
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
What a great place.
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
It's simply the best meal in NYC.
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
Staff is very accomodating.
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
Raymond the bartender rocks!
The place is beautiful!
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
The restaurant is cute but not upscale.
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
first it took us a long time to find the place.
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.
Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.
Indoor was very cozy and cute.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.
The fish was really,really fresh.
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE ...)
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.
The food is excellent! 
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
